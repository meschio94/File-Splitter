# File-Splitter

This is my first Project, this program was made for my Computer Science University, Unimore, Object Programmin exam, we used Java.

The objective was to create a program for splits a list of Files with different type of operations: <p>
-Split for dimension of parts<p>
-Split for nr of parts<p>
-Split for dimension and encrypt<p>
-Split for dimension and compress<p>
<p>
The program needed a GUI for the user and an option for reverse the split operation and reconstruct the file, the constraints was to use only Java library without implements any external library.

For the GUI i opted for javaFX, it was a bit hard because during the course we only saw Swing, but i wanted to implement a good GUI!

I opted for a minimalist GUI as you can see from the screenshoot.
